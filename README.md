- **Advanced Security** – Motion detectors, CCTV surveillance, RFID-based safe room.  
- **Safety Automation** – Fire, smoke, CO, and CO₂ detectors linked to alarms & ventilation.  
- **Sustainability** – Solar-powered appliances with battery backup to reduce electricity costs.  
- **Elderly-Friendly Automation** – Motion-based lighting, fan/AC activation, panic button with MCU alarm.  
- **Smart Irrigation & Water Safety** – Lawn sprinkler automation and kitchen sink overflow prevention.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** – Network simulation and IoT device integration.  
- **IoT Devices** – Sensors, actuators, smart appliances.  
- **Networking Components** – Routers, switches, gateways, cloud server.  
- **Programming** – JavaScript for microcontroller (MCU) automation.  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. Open the `.pkt` file in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
2. Use the **control device (tablet)** to manage IoT devices remotely.  
3. Observe automation in action:
   - Motion detection → CCTV + alarms.  
   - Fire/smoke detection → sprinklers + auto-unlock doors/windows.  
   - Solar panel → supplies power & stores energy in battery.  
   - Elderly-friendly room → auto door, lights, fan, AC, and panic button system.  
   - Water management → lawn irrigation & kitchen sink overflow prevention.  


## 📊 Project Highlights  
- Enhances **home safety & security**.  
- Promotes **energy efficiency & sustainability**.  
- Improves **quality of life** for elderly residents.  
- Demonstrates **real-world IoT applications** in smart homes.
